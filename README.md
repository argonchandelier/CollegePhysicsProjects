# CollegePhysicsProjects
Compilation of physics projects from college

by Logan Richan

So far everything in here is in Python.
Most scripts involve plotting, and some even have animations or 3D plots.
I tried to fix/update everything I could before uploading here, but there may be some bugs or inaccuracies.
A few files like gaussxw and the txt files are not mine, but are free to use and are utilized in some scripts.
